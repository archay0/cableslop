# Custom Cables.gl Ops Library

This repository is a collection of custom coded cables.gl ops for visual and art programming. Each op is stored in its own folder, containing a JavaScript file and a JSON file. Additionally, there is an optional folder to keep library files for each op, which can be imported into the op they are meant for.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/ops/` directory.
3. Find the op you want to use and navigate to its folder.
4. Use the JavaScript and JSON files as needed in your cables.gl project.
5. If the op has a library folder, you can import the library files into the op's JavaScript file.
